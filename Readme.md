# TDD katas in TypeScript with Jest

This repo provides a starting point for doing TDD (kata) in TypeScript with Jest.

## Preliminaries

1. Clone this repo
2. In a terminal (e.g., from VSCode) run `npm install`
3. `npm test` should show that the sample test passes for the module in `src/systemUnderTest.ts`

The project is configured with tests in the `test` directory, and source files in the `src` directory.
